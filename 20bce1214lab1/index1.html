<h3><tt><b>HTML</b> is really a very simple language. It consists of ordinary text, with commands that are enclosed by "<" and ">" an "&" and ";" (for example <html>). You don't really need to know much HTML to create a page, because you can copy bits of HTML from other pages that do what you want, then change the text! This page shows on the left as it appears in your browser, and the corresponding HTML code appears on the right. The HTML commands are linked to explanations of what they do.</tt></h3>
<h4 align="center"><b>Line Breaks</b></h4>
<h3><marquee behavior="scroll" direction="right">HTML doesn't normally use line breaks for ordinary text. A white space of any size is treated as a single space.The code type can also be used in html for example</marquee></h3>
<h4><tt>#include<iostream.h><br>void main()<br>{<br>cout<<"This is simple program";<br>}</tt></h4>
<h3> If you want to put multiple spaces, then you can use non breaking entitiy by multiple times.For ex.,I would like to use 3 more blankspaces &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp here.If you want to put a line break at a particular place,you can use the "<<b>BR</b>>" command, or, for a paragraph break, the "<<b>p</b>>" command, which will insert a blank line. You can also use some extended text formating features such as superscript, subscript and mark features like this</h3>
<h4>1<sup>st</sup>,2<sub>nd</sub> and <b>emphasized format features.<P>Starting and Stopping Commands</b></h4>
<h3 align="right"><tt>Most HTML commands come in pairs: for example, "<"H4">" marks the beginning of size 4 heading, and "<<b>/H4</b>>" marks the end of it. The closing command is always the same as the opening command, except for the addition of the "/".</tt></h3>
<h3>Modifiers are sometimes included along with the basic command, inside the opening command's<>. The modifier does not need to be repeated in the closing command.</h3>
<h1 align="center"><b>This is size "1" heading</b></h1>
<h2 align="left"><b>This is a size "2" heading</b></h2>
<h3 align="right"><b>This is a size "3" heading</b></h3>
